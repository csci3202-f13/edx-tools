# Gather data on student progress by scraping edX course site as an instructor
# Usage: edx-dump [-d]
# By default it downloads progress reports for all users specified in the config file and puts them in the "progress" directory
# The -d  option gets detailed submission histories on the problems specified in the config file, rather than progress reports
# and puts them in directories named after the problem.
# For more info for debugging, use   bash -x ./edx-dump

# TODO:
#  Add options for setting $do_progress and $do_detail.  Currently just gets progress report, but could get detailed submission history
#  Login via password and get our own cookies
#  Add test cases

# Default is to just get the progress reports
